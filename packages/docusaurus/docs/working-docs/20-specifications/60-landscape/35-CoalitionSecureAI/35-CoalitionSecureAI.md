# Coalition for secure AI

Securing AI and AI applications and services is a fragmented endeavor. Developers grapple with a patchwork of guidelines and standards which are often inconsistent and siloed. Assessing and mitigating AI specific and prevalent risks without clear best practices and standardized approaches is a significant challenge for even the most experienced organizations.

Coalition for Secure AI aims to address this challenge by fostering a collaborative ecosystem with diverse stakeholders across companies, academia and other relevant fields who can work together to develop and share holistic approaches, including best practices, tools and methodologies for secure AI development and deployment.
