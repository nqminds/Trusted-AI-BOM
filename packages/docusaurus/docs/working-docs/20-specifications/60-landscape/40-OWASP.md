# OWASP LLM_AI_Security_and_Governance_Checklist



The OWASP "LLM AI Security and Governance Checklist" v1 is a comprehensive document aimed at ensuring the secure and ethical deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's an extensive summary of its content:

### Introduction
The document emphasizes the increasing adoption of LLMs in various applications, necessitating robust security and governance practices to mitigate risks such as data breaches, misuse, and ethical issues.

### Governance and Management

1. **Policy and Compliance**: Establish clear policies for LLM use, aligning with legal and regulatory requirements. Ensure compliance through regular audits and updates.
2. **Risk Management**: Identify, assess, and manage risks associated with LLMs. Implement a risk management framework to address potential threats.
3. **Data Governance**: Manage data responsibly by ensuring data quality, privacy, and security. Implement data lifecycle management practices, including data anonymization and encryption.

### Security Practices

1. **Access Control**: Implement robust access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to LLMs and their data. Use role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
2. **Incident Response**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan to address security breaches and other incidents. Ensure the plan includes clear roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols.
3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Continuously monitor LLM activities and maintain detailed logs. Use monitoring tools to detect anomalies and potential security threats.

### Ethical and Responsible AI

1. **Bias and Fairness**: Implement measures to identify and mitigate biases in LLMs. Regularly evaluate model outputs to ensure fairness and avoid discrimination.
2. **Transparency and Explainability**: Ensure LLM decisions and processes are transparent and explainable. Provide clear documentation and explanations for model behavior and outputs.
3. **User Consent and Privacy**: Respect user privacy by obtaining explicit consent for data use. Implement privacy-preserving techniques and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

### Technical Controls

1. **Model Security**: Protect LLMs from adversarial attacks and unauthorized modifications. Use techniques like adversarial training and model validation to enhance security.
2. **Data Security**: Ensure data used for training and inference is securely stored and transmitted. Implement encryption and access controls to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
3. **Deployment Security**: Secure the deployment environment by using containerization, orchestration, and regular security assessments. Ensure continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are secure.

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Training and Awareness**: Provide ongoing training and awareness programs for staff and stakeholders on LLM security and governance practices. Ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities.
2. **Evaluation and Audits**: Conduct regular evaluations and audits of LLM security and governance practices. Use the findings to improve policies, procedures, and technical controls.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with stakeholders, including users, regulators, and industry groups, to understand their concerns and requirements. Use their feedback to improve LLM practices.

### Conclusion

The OWASP checklist serves as a foundational document to guide organisations in deploying LLMs securely and responsibly. By following these best practices, organisations can mitigate risks, ensure compliance, and promote the ethical use of AI technologies.
